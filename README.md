# Haptic Vest Computer Vision Project
Herein lies the almighty Haptic Vest project.

# Components
It consists of a few parts:
 - data_pipeline.ipynb: the data prep code for training the models
 - tensorflow_person_model.ipynb: a keras model that has been hand-toggled
 - logistic_regression.ipynb: [does not exist yet] a logistic regression model to fit our problem
 - rounded_model.ipynb: [does not exist yet] a fully connected neural network with handmade gradient descent changes
 - squeeze_net.ipynb: [does not exist yet] a retrained version of SqueezeNet
